### `TODOS`

- Runtime vs design mode
- How to remove components? - let components decide on what options to show?
- How to add components? - hard code some decent examples (e.g. a chart)
- Adding drop zones in between components (Render area helper..) (Should be able to use renderDropZone + index)
- // useful reasd, custom context + selectors https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#custom-context

# As a library

- Initialize widgets, in a single ton, whats a good pattern for this, rather than relying on props down the chain (Possibly some kind of initConfig from the root?)
- Look at using redux as a 'library' hide away the redux implementation? / or inject as middleware
