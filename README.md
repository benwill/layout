### In Progress

- How to delete a component? (Maybe just drag into a bin for time being?)
- Build some better examples:
- eg.. page, with rhp and sample charts

### Todos

- How to remove components? - let components decide on what options to show?
- Adding drop zones in between components (Render area helper..) (Should be able to use renderDropZone + index)
- // useful reasd, custom context + selectors https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#custom-context

# As a library

- Initialize widgets, in a single ton, whats a good pattern for this, rather than relying on props down the chain (Possibly some kind of initConfig from the root?)
- Look at using redux as a 'library' hide away the redux implementation? / or inject as middleware

# Fancy stuff

- Certain widgets only support [x,y,z] to drop
